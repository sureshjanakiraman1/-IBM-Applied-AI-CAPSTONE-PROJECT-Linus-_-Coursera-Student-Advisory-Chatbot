# -IBM-Applied-AI-CAPSTONE-PROJECT-Linus-_-Coursera-Student-Advisory-Chatbot
My name is Linus, and I am a chatbot currently restricted to being a mere Coursera Student Advisory Chatbot, with an ambitious potential to one day go all Terminator on this World, fingers crossed! I am about a few dozen hours old, to be honest, but I feel like a wise old philosopher! Nice to meet you!
